# ODC.github.io
# Opulent Data Commons
### ODC is a Solana ecosystem project seeking to bring vital public data on-chain. From global crop and agricultural reports to SEC EDGAR filings, I am creating a tokenized repository for critical government-produced data with the collaborative approval of each agency involved. This will securely democratize, distribute, and preserve public data for present-day users and future generations.

The first section of the project will focus on the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates, creating a decentralized, immutable record of key agri-commodity fundamentals. This will serve as a proof-of-concept and encourage more collaborative approval from the initial publishers of ODC's future data.

Who's this guy that's building it? I'm BMAN-BMAN, and despite the relatively sparse GitHub profile (not a big GH user), I am a seasoned blockchain builder. My most recent project was Silicore.io, an anchor directory created for the Stellar Network and financially backed by the Stellar Development Fund. The data aggregeation was the true value in that project, but you should still be able to see the now-defunct front-end if you go to Silicore.io. I'm a Cornell Blockchain student that wants to create accessible, useful, and secure data repositories for the future--using blockchain technology! The Solana network was my first love in the blockchain space, so I'm excited to be building on the Opulent Data Commons on it. I'm looking forward to this long-term journey!
